# Statistical-Learning-Projects

This repository contains two Statistical Learning projects, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis and modeling.

## Project 1: Mine Dataset Analysis

### Overview
This project analyzes a mine dataset to explore relationships between various factors such as voltage (V), height (H), and soil type (S). The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the application of various clustering techniques.

### Key Features
- Data preprocessing and imputation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with various visualizations
- Implementation of clustering algorithms:
  - K-means clustering
  - Hierarchical clustering
  - Kernel PCA
- Model evaluation and comparison

### Technologies Used
- **R**
- Libraries: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `cluster`, `factoextra`, `corrplot`, `caret`, `rpart`, `gridExtra`, `plotly`

## Project 2: Oil Price Time Series Analysis

### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting oil prices using time series data. It employs various forecasting models and compares their performance.

### Key Features
- Time series data visualization
- Data imputation for missing values
- Implementation of forecasting models:
  - ETS (Error-Trend-Seasonality) models
  - Holt-Winters models
  - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
  - Weighted Moving Average (WMA)
- Model adequacy checking using statistical tests
- Performance comparison using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE

### Technologies Used
- **R**
- Libraries: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `zoo`, `forecast`, `TTR`, `e1071`
